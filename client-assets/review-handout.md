# How to Request Reviews from North London Clients

**For the Local Painter & Decorators Team**

---

## Why Reviews Matter

Google reviews are one of the most powerful tools for growing our business in North London:

- **Local Visibility**: Google Business Profile (GBP) reviews directly impact local search rankings. More positive reviews = higher visibility in "painters near me" searches.
- **Trust & Credibility**: 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. A strong review profile converts browsers into bookers.
- **Free Marketing**: Every 5-star review with photos and detailed text is working for us 24/7, showing up in search results and on our GBP listing.
- **Competitive Edge**: Standing out in a crowded North London market requires social proof. Reviews differentiate us from competitors.

**Goal**: Aim to request a review from every satisfied customer. Even a 50% success rate significantly boosts our online presence.

## When to Ask for Reviews

Timing is critical. Ask when satisfaction is highest:

### 1. **Handover Day (Best Time)**
Right after final walk-through when the customer is seeing the finished result and is most impressed. Strike while the iron is hot.

**Script**: *"We're really pleased with how it's turned out, and I hope you are too. If you're happy with the work, a quick Google review would mean the world to us. It helps local families find us and only takes a minute. I can send you the link now if you have your phone handy?"*

### 2. **48 Hours Later (Follow-up)**
If you didn't ask on handover day, or they seemed rushed, follow up with a text or WhatsApp message.

**Template**: See "Text/WhatsApp Template" below.

### 3. **After Snag-List Completion**
If there were minor issues that you've now resolved, this is a great time to ask. It demonstrates you stand behind your work.

**Script**: *"Thanks for your patience while we sorted that out. Now that everything's perfect, we'd really appreciate a Google review if you have a moment. It helps us grow our business across North London."*

## How to Ask (Verbal Script)

Use this simple, friendly 3-step approach:

1. **Qualify satisfaction**: *"Are you happy with everything?"* (Wait for confirmation)

2. **Make the ask**: *"If you're pleased with the work, a short Google review would really help us. It takes under a minute and makes a huge difference to local families trying to find a reliable decorator."*

3. **Offer to help**: *"I can send you the link right now via text, or you can search 'Local Painter & Decorators' on Google and click 'Write a review'. Would you prefer a link?"*

**Key Tips:**
- Be genuine, not pushy
- Emphasise it's quick (under 1 minute)
- Explain it helps other local homeowners
- Offer to send the link immediately

## What Makes a Great Review?

Guide customers on what to include (without dictating or sounding pushy):

**Ideal elements:**
- ✅ **Area/postcode** (e.g., "We're in Finchley N3...")
- ✅ **Job type** (e.g., "They painted our living room and hallway...")
- ✅ **Result/quality** (e.g., "The finish is flawless...")
- ✅ **Timeliness** (e.g., "They finished on schedule...")
- ✅ **Cleanliness/professionalism** (e.g., "Left everything spotless...")
- ✅ **Photos** (before/after shots are gold)

**Example great review**:
*"We used Local Painter & Decorators for our Victorian terrace in Crouch End. They painted three bedrooms, the hallway, and all the woodwork. The finish is immaculate, they were tidy and reliable, and they finished a day early. Highly recommend for anyone in North London. 5 stars!"*

**Gentle nudge (if appropriate)**:
*"If you mention the area and what we painted, it really helps other locals searching for decorators. And if you have any photos, they're brilliant!"*
